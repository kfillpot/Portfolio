# Things that need to be adjusted

  1. Download link needs to actually download resume - currently changed it so it opens a second tab where the resume can be downloaded.
  2. Resume information needs to be changed
   a. Going to send to career services, as I do not have any real world coding experience.
  3. Working on getting the contact form working properly. Currently does not send anywhere.
  
# Things I would like to add

  1. Want a more fleshed out projects section. There is not currently alot to see.
   a. This has a lot to do with the fact that my ReadMe's are not thorough or informative.
